# Xuanwu Research Workflow

This prompt consolidates repository-packaging and evidence-gathering workflows into one Xuanwu-specific research command.

## Serena lifecycle

- Follow the Serena session-start sequence from [../copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) before broad repository discovery.
- Before finishing, persist durable Serena memory updates when facts changed and rely on the workspace Stop hook for index refresh.

## Modes

1. **Codebase discovery** — identify files, patterns, and boundaries relevant to the task.
2. **Repository packaging** — use Repomix when broad cross-file context is required.
3. **Reference synthesis** — summarize architecture, tooling, or implementation evidence for downstream work.

## Guardrails

- Prefer factual findings over speculative advice.
- Cite the repository sources that support the conclusion.
- Recommend the next specialist workflow if research alone is insufficient.
