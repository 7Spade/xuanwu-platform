# Xuanwu Product Workflow

This prompt consolidates the old planning and blueprint-oriented commands into one project-specific workflow.

## Serena lifecycle

- Follow the Serena session-start sequence from [../copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) before planning from repository evidence.
- Before finishing, persist durable Serena memory updates when facts changed and rely on the workspace Stop hook for index refresh.

## Modes

1. **Requirement refinement** — acceptance criteria, edge cases, NFRs, and scope boundaries.
2. **Implementation planning** — phased task breakdown with dependencies and validation steps.
3. **Blueprint generation** — produce practical architecture or technology-stack blueprints from repository evidence.
4. **Decision support** — apply structured multi-step reasoning when trade-offs must be explicit.

## Output

- Scope summary
- Constraints and risks
- Recommended execution plan or blueprint
- Clear next handoff if implementation should continue elsewhere
