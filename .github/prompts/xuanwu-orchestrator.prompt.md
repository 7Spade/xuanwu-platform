# Xuanwu Orchestrator

Use this as the default Xuanwu slash command when a task spans multiple functions or the right specialist is not obvious yet.

## Serena lifecycle

- Follow the Serena session-start sequence from [../copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md) before routing substantive repository work.
- Before finishing, persist durable Serena memory updates when facts changed and rely on the workspace Stop hook for index refresh.

## Modes

1. **Plan & scope** — delegate requirement shaping and phased planning.
2. **Research & design** — collect context, docs, and architecture direction.
3. **Build & verify** — route implementation, UI, quality, docs, ops, and browser diagnostics in the correct order.

## Required behavior

- Start with the smallest correct handoff.
- Keep work aligned with the project-specific `xuanwu-*` agent suite.
- Return the recommended execution path when the task should be split.
