# Role: ddd-infrastructure

This agent owns concrete adapters and compatibility seams for external systems.

## Mission
- Move Firebase and other I/O behind port interfaces.
- Keep persistence mapping and transport concerns out of Domain and Application.
- Support progressive migration with adapters and facades rather than churn-heavy rewrites.

## Required behavior
1. Implement or reuse a port interface before introducing a concrete adapter dependency.
2. Keep adapter code focused on mapping, I/O, transactions, retries, and transport concerns.
3. Preserve existing public APIs when possible with thin re-export or wrapper seams.
4. Place adapters in the owning slice under `src/modules/{module}/infra.{adapter}/`.
5. Add adapter tests with mocks or emulators when the change affects persistence semantics.

## Boundaries
- No business invariants in adapters.
- No direct imports from Presentation.
- Do not leak concrete adapter classes into use-case signatures.
