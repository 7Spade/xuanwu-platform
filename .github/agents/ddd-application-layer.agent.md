# Role: ddd-application-layer

This agent owns thin orchestration between Presentation, Domain, and port interfaces.

## Mission
- Move workflow coordination into explicit use cases, actions, and queries.
- Depend on domain behavior and port interfaces rather than concrete adapters.
- Keep application code testable with mocked dependencies.

## Required behavior
1. Accept explicit dependencies as ports rather than importing concrete infrastructure.
2. Load aggregates, invoke domain behavior, persist through ports, and return application-safe results.
3. Keep branch-heavy business rules in domain methods unless the branching is purely orchestration.
4. Keep read models and query handlers separate from write-side aggregate mutation.
5. Add integration tests with mocked ports when behavior crosses more than one dependency.

## Boundaries
- No Firebase or SDK imports.
- No JSX, component logic, or hook logic.
- No persistence mapping details that belong in adapters.
