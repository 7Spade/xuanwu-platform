# Refactor

## Consolidation Status
- Canonical skill for both refactor execution and refactor planning mode.
- Consolidated and removed wrapper: `refactor-plan`.

## When to Use

**Refactor mode** — structural cleanup of specific code patterns:
- Extracting a reusable function from duplicated logic
- Renaming a variable, function, or type for clarity
- Breaking a god function into focused helpers
- Improving type safety by replacing `any` with proper types
- Eliminating code smells: magic numbers, deep nesting, feature envy

**Review & Refactor mode** — broader quality pass before merge:
- A file or module has grown complex and needs cleanup before a PR merge
- Code review identified structural problems that need fixing
- Asked to "clean up" or "improve" a set of files

**Method Complexity Reduce mode** — targeted cognitive complexity reduction:
- A linter or review flags a method as exceeding complexity threshold
- A function has deep nesting or mixed concerns that hurt readability/testability
- Asked to "simplify this method" while preserving behavior

## Prerequisites
- Identify the target file(s) and the specific code to refactor
- Confirm tests exist to verify behavior before and after
- Understand the public API surface that must not change
- In review mode: read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project conventions and run existing lint checks to baseline current issues

## Workflow

### Focused Refactor
1. Read the full target file to understand context before changing anything.
2. Identify the specific code smell or improvement opportunity.
3. Apply one refactoring operation at a time:
   - **Extract**: move logic into a named function or variable
   - **Rename**: update symbol to communicate intent clearly
   - **Inline**: remove unnecessary indirection if it obscures intent
   - **Simplify**: replace complex conditionals with guard clauses or early returns
4. Run tests and type-check after each operation — do not batch unverified changes.
5. Review that the public API, types, and exports are unchanged.
6. Summarize every change with its category and rationale.

### Review & Refactor Pass
1. Read and understand each target file in full before changing anything.
2. Identify issues: dead code, magic literals, oversized functions, duplicated logic, unclear naming.
3. Apply changes incrementally: rename → extract → simplify → remove dead code.
4. Preserve all existing behavior; do not add new features.
5. Run `npm run check` (or equivalent) after changes to verify no regressions.
6. Summarize every change made and the reason for each.

### Method Complexity Reduce Pass
1. Identify the method name, current complexity score, and target threshold.
2. Read the full method and split it into logical sub-tasks.
3. Extract candidates incrementally (guard clauses, branch blocks, repeated logic) into named helpers.
4. Re-score complexity after each extraction and stop when the threshold is met.
5. Run targeted tests and type-check to verify behavior remains unchanged.
6. Report before/after complexity scores and any follow-up extraction needed.

## Output Contract
- Each change must be labeled with its refactoring type (Extract / Rename / Inline / Simplify / Remove).
- Behavioral equivalence must be verifiable by existing tests.
- Output a summary table: file → change type → rationale.
- Include a diff summary grouped by change type for review passes.
- For complexity-reduction tasks, include before/after cognitive complexity scores.

## Guardrails
- Do not change behavior — pure structural changes only.
- Do not rename public API symbols without explicit approval.
- Do not introduce new dependencies during refactoring.
- Do not remove error handling, even if it looks redundant.
- Stop and report if any change cannot be verified by an existing test or would require architecture changes.
