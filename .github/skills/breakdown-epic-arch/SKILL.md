# Breakdown Epic Arch

## When to Use
- A Product Requirements Document (PRD) exists and needs translation into a technical design
- Defining component responsibilities and service boundaries for a new epic
- Mapping data flows, APIs, and integration points before development starts

## Prerequisites
- Read the Epic PRD created by the `breakdown-epic-pm` skill
- Review `docs/architecture/README.md` for existing architectural constraints
- Identify which existing slices or modules will be affected

## Workflow
1. Parse the PRD: extract goals, user stories, and functional requirements.
2. Identify system components: new services, updated modules, external integrations.
3. Define service/module boundaries: what each component owns and what it does NOT own.
4. Design data models: entities, relationships, and storage strategy.
5. Map data flows: sequence diagrams or flow descriptions for main use cases.
6. List API contracts: endpoints, input/output schemas, error codes.
7. Identify non-functional requirements: performance, security, availability implications.
8. Flag architecture decisions that need ADR (Architecture Decision Record) documentation.

## Output Contract
- Produce an architecture doc with: Components, Boundaries, Data Models, Data Flows, API Contracts, NFRs, Open Questions.
- Each component boundary must explicitly state its responsibilities and dependencies.
- Flag ADR-worthy decisions separately for human review.

## Guardrails
- Respect existing architectural boundaries defined in `docs/architecture/`.
- Do not introduce new cross-boundary dependencies without an explicit justification.
- Align all entity names with `.serena\memories\*`.
